Hi John,
Great project, it's clear you have understood the concepts here really well. You have missed the quoutes around the spacer_footer class, which may caused some issues. Also make sure you choose 2 or 4 spaces for indentation and try to stay consistent with it.
Overall though it's a really fantastic result, awesome progress so far.
